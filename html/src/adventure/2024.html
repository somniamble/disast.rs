<h1>December Adventure 2024</h1>

<p>Welcome to my <em>#2024DecentureAdvember</em> log</p>

<p>This december I'm deciding to focus on term re-writing. <!-- and present-tense writing --></p>

<p>A secondary objective will be re-writing the site. It's important!</p>

  <h2>Day 22</h2>
  <p>I am beginning to thing that I should wrap up this year's DecemberAdventure.</p>
  <p>This month I have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explored term-rewriting, via Modal.</li>
    <li>Unstyled the site, and began re-styling it slowly by hand. (Simplify!)</li>
    <li>Made some illustration tools, almost on accident. (Fun!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I also received my jiu jitsu blue belt, and drank a lot of water. (Hydration?)
  <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
  <p>When I asked on Merveilles how other multi-disciplinary artists "keep it together", I got one response, from
    Devine:</p>
  <blockquote>"journaling"</blockquote>
  <p>I'm honestly pretty new to this, trying to write constructively about what I'm doing, as I'm doing it.</p>
  <p>I've journalled before, extensively, and when I went back to re-read them this year I found the contents utterly
    useless.</p>
  <p>This was because I was often only writing about my hard feelings. (Somehow, writing about them didn't make them any
    softer.)</p>
  <p>I am also pretty new to trying to approach art more systematically than "Just do what I feel like".</p>
  <!-- This probably shows. -->
  <p>This seems important to figure out, though. I am spread somewhat thin, in terms of interests. Finding through-lines
    is essential.</p>
  <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
  <p>I think if you're aware of what you're doing, as you're doing it, you'll automatically refine your approach.</p>
  <p>It could be the dishes, cooking mussels, routing baseboards, chopping breaks, etc.</p>
  <p>There's work to do, too, you can't just retreat into what's rote -- that would seem to be a strategy to avoid being
    present.</p>
  <p>In a way, a more refined approach is more empty -- maybe you're doing less, maybe as you "get better" you're paring
    away more and more unnecessary movement</p>
  <p>In a way, a more refined approach is more full -- maybe what you're doing fits closer and closer to the subject
    matter and substance of the medium.</p>
  <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
  <h3>What now?</h3>
  <p>I haven't touched upon Fractran, or Vera, or any other re-writing language.</p>
  <p>My site is still half one thing, half another. I will continue to write for it, and let my writing workflow
    co-evolve with the structure for it. I really like this format.</p>

  <h2>Day 20</h2>
  <p>I decide to tackle my implementation of Conway's Game of Life</p>
  <p>I learned something very useful, which is that the color codes used in Thuesday (<code>#72dec1</code>) are parsed
    as integers. So, we can do normal math on them.</p>
  <p>I also had the idea of using the first row of pixels on my screen as ram for my implementation.</p>
  <p>When evaluating one tick in the Game of Life, you have to buffer (at minimum) the most-recently evaluated cell, as
    well as the previous row of cells, otherwise you <em>lose access</em> to that history when you draw your new cells
    in the grid</p>
  <p>How's the implementation going, you ask?</p>
  <p><a href="2024/conway-part3.html">Bad.</a></p>
  <p>: : : :</p>
  <p>Because I cannot leave well enough alone, and because I will have no time tomorrow, I decided to finish my
    implementation today.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyvqVDAGU0s">What the hell, I did all the chores already, and it's the
      start of vacation."</a></p>
  <img src="/images/pulsar.gif" alt="The Pulsar oscillator, from Conway's Game of Life." />
  <img src="/images/randautomata.gif" alt="Conway's game of life, starting from a random seed." />
  <p>My implementation is <a href="2024/conway-finish.html">here</a></p>
  <p>There are still bugs, I'm sure, because things behave oddly at the boundaries.</p>
  <p>I would probably fix this by adding more granular re-write rules for the edge-cases.</p>
  <p>There are also optimizations one could do --</p>
  <p>For example, instead doing two row-copies every row, you could copy to row 0 and row 1 alternately, and use
    alternating rules to get neighbors from it.</p>
  <p>But this is done. I'm going to say it's done now.</p>

  <h2>Day 19</h2>
  <p>I have finished working at my day job for the year!</p>
  <p>Yesterday I stretched a bit to finish Poly-Gonner</p>
  <p>Today I realize I'm not so sure what to with Modal</p>
  <p>Then I also thought, "What's the point of making these cool tools if you don't use them?"</p>
  <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
  <p>I think these partially-occluded lines you can get from drawing black lines on top of colored lines are very
    interesting. They reveal something about the line-drawing algorithm, that I don't "get" by reading the source code.
  </p>
  <img src="/images/an-abstract-thing.png" alt="I sometimes thing \" Why bother drawing such abstract little doodles?\"
    But nobody else will draw them like I do, so this thought is not worth entertaining." />
  <p>Reading the source code is also important. Reading the source code would have helped me earlier when I attempted an
    ill-fated optimization.</p>
  <p>Maybe I should do that next?</p>

  <h2>Day 14</h2>

  <p>Unrelated to creative coding, but otherwise related to my work as an artist, I decided it was finally time to patch
    my jeans.</p>

  <p>I got it in my head to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashiko">Sashiko-style</a> stitching for the
    patch.</p>

  <p>However, I do not have the weight of thread necessary for it.</p>

  <p>I found myself unable to move forward, because I wanted to get the project started.</p>

  <p>So I used a little bit of PVA to glue the bottom end of the patch in place.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGZ0l8vXTRg">Now I can move on!</a></p>

  <img src="/images/four-brothers-reverset.png" alt="you are met by four brothers on the road" />

  <p>I thought: "What if I could draw quadrangles too?"</p>

  <p>We can track one more set of coordingates in the draw rule</p>

  <p>Now the triangler to make is a quadrangler instead:</p>

  <pre>

    &lt;&gt;> (state ((?a ?b) ((?c ?d) ((?e ?f) ((?g ?h) ?s)))) listening)

    (draw line (number ?a) (number ?b) (number ?c) (number ?d) (color #ff0000)
    draw line (number ?c) (number ?d) (number ?e) (number ?f) (color #cc0000)
    draw line (number ?e) (number ?f) (number ?g) (number ?h) (color #aa0000)
    draw line (number ?g) (number ?h) (number ?a) (number ?b) (color #880000)
    state ?s listening)
  </pre>

  <p>This makes me wonder how I would draw a polygon of any number of sides</p>

  <p>We would need a running iteration step that also kept track of the first point, for the last line.</p>

  <p>What If I wanted to draw circles, too?</p>

  <p>Then I would need to be able to calculate square roots, for the distance between two points.</p>

  <h2>Day 13</h2>

  <p>Today I decided I would try chunking my iteration step into rows</p>

  <p>This way, for a grid of 256x256 pixels, I could cut some math rewrites out of the inner iteration loop</p>

  <p>I <em>was</em> successful at creating a rule which would draw an entire row of random pixels</p>

  <p>For example, for a grid size of `4`, I would generate a rule like this:</p>

  <code> &lt;&gt; ((?r) do-row) ((flip-flatten ((1 ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) ((2 ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) ((3 ?r (0 2 `rand)
    cell) (($screen-size ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) ()))))) (?r 1 `-) do-row) </code>

  <p>In an ideal world, I would generate a rule like this (notice that the `cell` calls are on the same level of
    nesting):</p>

  <code>&lt;&gt; ((?r) do-row) ((1 ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) (2 ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) (3 ?r (0 2 `rand) cell) (4 ?r (0 2
    `rand) cell) (?r 1 `-) do-row)</code>

  <p>(Looking at this now, I noticed another bug with my row-rule, but it's much too late to fix it.)</p>

  <p>However, I needed some way to deal with the remains of evaluation of the row-rule, which was producing <i>vast</i>
    nested empty tuples.</p>

  <p>I tried to flatten my cons-cells out using `flip-flatten`, but this resulted in modal applying the `flip-flatten`
    rule inside the row-iteration step</p>

  <p>This resulted in a noticeably slower implementation than yesterdays.</p>

  <p>Have I learned a lesson?</p>

  <details>
    <summary>(It turns out there is an explanation for this. Thanks CapitalEx!)</summary>
    <pre>
      <i>CapitalEx — Today at 2:17 PM</i>
      When I was trying to make modal program fast, the number one thing I tried to do was make my program size stay
      extremely small
      <i>rosin — Today at 2:17 PM</i>
      I was curious to see if it would be faster to do a single large expansion of size n, rather than n small
      expansions
      in fact, as far as I can tell the do-row version of the program has 1 fewer re-write per cell, but it's still
      slower
      so what I am learning here is that indeed it is better to keep things small
      <i>CapitalEx — Today at 2:19 PM</i>
      Devines implementation flips your program between two buffers. It writes your changes first, then copies the rest
      of the old buffer. So the long that copy has to be the slower things run.
      <i>rosin — Today at 2:19 PM</i>
      aha
      Thank you for the explanation
      <i>CapitalEx — Today at 2:19 PM</i>
      No problem
      <i>rosin — Today at 2:19 PM</i>
      it was worth the attempt &gt;:)
      <i>(wryl) — Today at 2:19 PM</i>
      The original Python implementation uses a single buffer, a queue, which means we don't need to spend time copying.
      But it's not fast because.. Python.
      <i>CapitalEx — Today at 2:20 PM</i>
      I've been meaning to write a compile to Lua for my implementation cause the C impl is still leagues faster lol
      (Well, outside of some cases where the rolling queue is a major win and the program is small)

  <p>I decide today's the day to learn to iterate</p>

  <p>The code became rather long again, so I will link to it: <a href="2024/conway-part2.html">Conway Part 2</a></p>

  <p>I can now draw a <strike>48x48</strike> 64x64 box of tv snow. Any larger and it is noticeably slow.</p>

  <p>It takes me <strike>6</strike> 5 re-writes to draw one pixel with this implementation. I wonder if I could get it
    lower?</p>

  <p>(As I wrote this entry, I came up with another little optimization to save one more rewrite.)</p>

  <img src="/images/tv-snow.gif" alt="a 48x48 box of flickering black and white TV snow" />

  <p>: : : :</p>

  <p>When I started today's work, I made an implementation of a random-pixel-painter using my function-application tool.
  </p>

  <p>These were nice for readability, but they added additional re-write steps.</p>

  <p>I also had a conditional expression, until I realized it was better to leverage the rewriter to handle conditional
    evaluation for me.</p>

  <p>To optimize in Modal, it's best to take out as many intermediate re-write steps as possible.</p>

  <p>It seems that there is no way to reduce IO rewrites. Or, is there?</p>

  <p>I also wonder if it's possible to perform loop-unrolling.</p>

  <p>I might run out of memory. Or, will I?</p>

  <h2>Day 11</h2>

  <p>I haven't been able to use variables in rule definitions. It's been bugging me a little bit.</p>

  <p>I decide to take a brief diversion from Life to figure this out.</p>

  <p>Variables are necessary for code readability.</p>

  <p>More than variables, it also allows applying all rewrites to the right-hand-side
    of a rule <em>before</em> creating it. If we're going to do much iteration, it would
    be helpful to move as much of the re-writing needed for an evaluation <em>outside</em>
    of the iteration step as possible. It's an optimization.</p>

  <p>Shift things left, basically.</p>

  <p>Is this applicative-order evaluation? I <i>think</i> so. In this case, we are fully-evaluating all rules before we
    register the new rule.</p>

  <pre>
    ?(?-) (Implement a syntax for evaluating variables in rule definition right-hand side)

    ?(?-) (
    The trick here is to use a lambda to delay evaluation of (?x ?y &lt;=&gt;) until after ?y is evaluated.

    This may be used as an alternative "fully evaluating" rule definition

    In order to match the syntax of "non-evaluating" rule definition, we need to match two cases:
    - right-hand-side is a tuple of 1 element (semantic unpack)
    - otherwise, unpack right-hand-side using ?. register
    )
    &lt;&gt; ((?x) (?y) &lt;=!=&gt;) (&lt;&gt; ?x ?y)
    &lt;&gt; ((?x) ?. &lt;=!=&gt;) (&lt;&gt; ?x (?.))
    &lt;&gt; (?x ?y &lt;=!=&gt;) (&lt;&gt; ?x ?y)
    &lt;&gt; (&lt;!&gt; ?x ?y) ((?x) (?y) ?(?x ?x) &lt;=!=&gt;)

    &lt;!&gt; $bam (of an englishmun)
    &lt;!&gt; $bar (I smell the blood)
    &lt;!&gt; ($fum) ($bar $bam)
    &lt;!&gt; (fee fie foe) ($fum)

    ?(?-) (this evaluates to:
    &lt;&gt; $giant-says (I smell the blood of an englishmun)
    )
    &lt;!&gt; $giant-says (fee fie foe)

    $giant-says

    ?(?-) (And do something similar, for lambdas. Have to use a different symbol than ?...)

  <p>I'm still recovering from a cold and a rather severe poison-ivy reaction, both of which totally disrupted my sleep

  <!-- happy Guru Rinpoche day! -->
  <p>I realize I am getting stuck in my head about doing more modal, so I decide to just do something:</p>
  <pre>
    ?(?-) (An implementation of conway's game of life, with a grid-size of 256.

    Incomplete.)

    ?((?0 ?1 ?:) ?:) 256 256 size

    &lt;&gt; (?x -&gt; ?y) (&lt;&gt; ?x ?y)

    $screen-size -&gt; (number 256)
    $live-color -&gt; (color #ffffff)
    $dead-color -&gt; (color #000000)

    ?(?-) (Utils)
    &lt;&gt; (?0 ?1 `?:) ?:
    &lt;&gt; (-1 ?x) (?x 1 `-)
    &lt;&gt; (+1 ?x) (?x 1 `+)
    &lt;&gt; (read ?: (point ?0 ?1) (color ?2)) ?:
    &lt;&gt; (draw ?: (point ?0 ?1) (color ?2)) ?:

    ?(?-) (Operations)
    &lt;&gt; (neighbors (point ?x ?y)) (
    (point -1 ?x -1 ?y)
    (point -1 ?x ?y)
    (point -1 ?x +1 ?y)
    (point ?x -1 ?y)
    (point ?x ?y)
    (point ?x +1 ?y)
    (point +1 ?x -1 ?y)
    (point +1 ?x ?y)
    (point +1 ?x +1 ?y)
    )

    draw pixel (point 128 128) (color #ffffff)

    read @pixel (point 128 128) (color #000000)

    (neighbors (point 128 128))
  </pre>

  <p>It took a little effort figuring out how to read a pixel. It turns out the documentation for Thuesday is not quite
    correct; you must supply a color to use as a default, in case you try to access out-of-bounds.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned.</p>

  <h2>Day 9</h2>
  <p>Work was a little heavy today, so I let my study of modal breathe a bit</p>

  <p>Instead, I made rice stir-fry, cleaned the kitchen, did my laundry, and read more <i>Hidden In Plain Sight
      (Amdur)</i></p>

  <p>: : : :</p>

  <p>I particularly liked this advice from <a href="https://avanier.dev/renaissance">Josh Avanier's site</a>, regarding
    website redesigns:</p>
  <blockquote><i>Strip everything down to just plain markup tags. No classes, no styling. Focus on how the information
      you’re presenting flows vertically. Format things semantically—use the correct headings, use articles and
      sections, etc. (see HTML § guidelines).</i></blockquote>

  <p>This adventure log is where I'm testing styles out. I'm trying to only add what's needed.</p>

  <p>Here is my stylesheet so far:</p>
  <pre>
    pre {
    background: #eee;
    margin: 0 -1em;
    padding: .5em 2em;
    overflow-x: scroll;
    }</pre>

  <p>Other than that, I refined the notes page, my about page, and deleted a lot of unlinked loose-leaf.</p>

  <p>You cannot see it, but this page is now subdivided with &lt;section&gt; tags :]</p>

<section id="Day 8">
  <h2>Day 8</h2>

  <p>I have a little less time today, because I spent so long in the city</p>

  <p>No problem though. It was a good use of time.</p>

  <p>: : : :</p>

  <p>I start off thinking about how I could make a buffered canvas -- like you would have for a drawing program</p>

  <p>You'd need something like that if you wanted to 1) draw a cursor without 2) drawing it permanently on your nice
    picture</p>

  <p>One idea that presents itself to me is buffering to a sprite. But there's an issue there, I don't understand how
    sprites work in modal</p>

  <p>I spend a little time reading thuesday's source, then I cut up Devine's sprite demo. Then, I start to get it.</p>

  <p>More on this later.</p>

  <p>: : : :</p>

  <p>I had this idea to add more brushes to my sketchpad, and make it behave slightly more like a real sketchpad (i.e.
    only draw when you're touching the page)</p>

  <p>The source code for it ended up a little bit large, so here's a link to it instead: <a
      href="2024/sketchbook.html">sketchbook.modal</a></p>

  <img src="/images/smudge.png" alt="smudge" />

  <p>After a few attempts, I even draw a passable <em>Hung</em>(<span class="tib">ཧཱུྃ</span>).</p>

  <img src="/images/hung01.png" alt="HUNG" />

  <p>I also retooled my triangle sketcher a bit, and made the lines 3-wide on the diagonal. I think it looks pleasant.
  </p>

  <img src="/images/curtain.png" alt="curtain" />

  <p>Then I have some cold sake, and write up this entry. What a day!</p>

  <p>In order to understand evaluation order, I thought it would be good to do a project that required some math</p>

  <p>My original idea was to draw a vector at the mouse indicating speed/direction.</p>

  <p>I spoke with my brother a bit before today's DecAdvemCture work</p>

  <p>While he was describing to me his goal of doing 20,000 (!) pull-ups this year, a thought occurred to me:</p>

  <p>"Some goals require pushing towards, and some goals pull you along. The pulling goals are <em>over there</em>.
    Pushing goals are <em>right here</em>. Pulling goals are <em>bounded</em>. Pushing goals are <em>boundless</em>."
  </p>

  <p>That is to say, a goal that can be accomplished is a pulling-goal. It pulls you toward it. Some effort is required,
    but it, the situation, naturally directs your efforts.</p>

  <p>: : : :</p>

  <p>Today I gave myself a challenge with modal: reverse a tuple</p>

  <pre>
    ?(?-) (Given a tuple of any number of elements, re-write the tuple in reverse order)

    ?(?-) (here is a cursor, her name is "zyp", and she flattens cons-cells into tuples)
    ?(?-) (she is very talented, and can work from either direction.)
    &lt;&gt; (&lt;-_-&gt; ()) ()
    &lt;&gt; (&lt;-_-&gt; (?x ?y)) (?x &lt;-_-&gt; ?y)

    .. (&lt;-_-&gt; (1 (2 (3 ()))))
    .. ((((() a) b) c) &lt;-_-&gt;)

    ?(?-) (Now, given zyp's example, can we reverse an exploded tuple?)
    &lt;&gt; (flipcons ()) ()
    &lt;&gt; (flipcons (?x ?y)) (flipcons ?y ?x)

    &lt;&gt; (rev ?*) (flipcons (?*))

    (rev (1 2 3 4))

    ?(?-) (Unfortunately, it doesn't behave like we expect -- instead it explodes nested lists too)
    (rev (foo bar baa ma (nested list) (another nested list) (an even (more (deeply) nested) list)))
  </pre>

  <p>A little disappointing, but it's ok. I enjoyed starting with a file that contained only a prompt, then trying to
    fulfill that prompt</p>

  <p>That was setting myself a "pulling-goal", rather than a "pushing goal" of "I'm going to figure out modal."</p>

    &lt;&gt; (nand #t #f) #t
    &lt;&gt; (nand #f #t) #t
    &lt;&gt; (nand #f #f) #t

    ?(?-) (It seems we have to explicitly unpack if we want to build things with nand)
    ?(?-) (I suspect this is because I am inadvertantly matching non-boolean expressions)
    ?(?-) (more on this later?)

    &lt;&gt; (nand (?x) (?y)) (nand ?x ?y)

    ?(?-) (The rest of the circuitry)
    &lt;&gt; (not ?x) (nand ?x ?x)
    &lt;&gt; (and ?x ?y) (not (nand ?x ?y))
    &lt;&gt; (or ?x ?y) (nand (not ?x) (not ?y))
    &lt;&gt; (xor ?x ?y) (and (or ?x ?y) (nand ?x ?y))

    ?(?-) (Now can we build up some kind of if-else expression?)
    ?(?-) (We will have to unpack here as well?)
    &lt;&gt; (if #t ?x ?y) ?x
    &lt;&gt; (if #f ?x ?y) ?y
    &lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?x) #t
    &lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?y) #f

    ?(?-) (Somehow our ternary operator does not behave as expected.)

    ?(?-) (Eval: `(if (#f) True! False!)`)
    .. if (eq #t #f) True! False!

    ?(?-) (Evaluates to `False!`, which is more like what we would expect)
    .. if eq #t #f True! False!

    ?(?-) (So, why is it that we seem to rewrite to a token sometimes and a one-element tuple other times?)
  </pre>
  <p>::::</p>

  <pre>
    ?(?-) (I decide to go and cover some basics)

    ?(?-) (A rule has the following syntax)
    ?(?-) (&lt;&gt; left right)
    &lt;&gt; hello goodbye
    .. hello ?(?-) (evaluates to `goodbye`)
    .. hellogoodbye ?(?-) (no match; no rule is applied)

    ?(?-) (What if we want to evaluate to something a little bigger than a token?)
    ?(?-) (tuples are "unpacked", I think this is a vocabulary word I am possibly misusing.)
    &lt;&gt; good (even better)
    .. good bye ?(?-) (evaluates to "even better bye")


    ?(?-) (Use registers)
    &lt;&gt; (swap ?x ?y) (?y ?x)
    &lt;&gt; (spin ?x ?y ?z) (?y ?z ?x)

    .. swap it out ?(?-) (evaluates to `out it`)
    .. spin me right round ?(?-) (evaluates to `right round me`)
    .. spin swap a b c d e ?(?-) (evaluates to `a b d c e`)
    .. spin (swap a b) c d e ?(?-) (evaluates to `c d (b a) e`)

    ?(?-) (I get as far as the I/O section before realizing that rule evaluation is tricky)

    ?(?-) (Consider I/O, maybe we want to check if a user enters the same thing twice?)
    ?(?-) (use the ?~ register to read input)
    ?(?-) (Oh, actually I don't know how to use stdin as an arg twice)
    &lt;&gt; (read ?~) ?~
    &lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?x) (these terms are equivalent)
    &lt;&gt; (eq ?x ?y) (these terms are different)


    ?(?-) (Oops, we match the eq rule here, and always get the true result.)
    eq (read stdin) (read stdin)


    ?(?-) (How would we achieve application of `eq` to the results of two sequential reads?)

  </pre>

  <p>:: I decide to try zooming in on what was confusing me above ::</p>

  <pre>

    ?(?-) (I will try to dig a little more into tuple/token rewriting now)


    &lt;&gt; (does-this-wrap ?x) (?x)
    .. does-this-wrap abc ?(?-) (evaluates to `abc`)
    .. does-this-wrap (abc) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(abc)`)
    .. (does-this-wrap abc) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(abc)`)
    .. (does-this-wrap (abc)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((abc))`)


    &lt;&gt; (what-about-this ?x) ?x
    .. what-about-this efg ?(?-) (evaluates to `efg`)
    .. what-about-this (efg) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(efg)`)
    .. (what-about-this efg) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(efg)`)
    .. (what-about-this (efg)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((efg))`)


    &lt;&gt; (and-this ?x) ((?x))
    .. and-this hij ?(?-) (evaluates to `(hij)`)
    .. and-this (hij) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((hij))`)
    .. (and-this hij) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((hij))`)
    .. (and-this (hij)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(((hij)))`)
  </pre>
