<h1>December Adventure 2024</h1>

<p>Welcome to my <em>#2024DecentureAdvember</em> log</p>

<p>This december I'm deciding to focus on term re-writing. <!-- and present-tense writing --></p>

<p>A secondary objective will be re-writing the site. It's important!</p>

<h2>Days</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#Day 1">Day 1 :: Intro to modal :: In which I am confused by single-token re-writes</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
  <li>have some fun</li>
  <li>simplify (!)</li>
  <li>stay hydrated</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="Day 1">Day 1</h2>

<pre>
Let's enumerate a couple ideas for December Adventure:
- re-build disast.rs (using term rewriting??)
- learn modal, and the ecosystem around it, and use it

Without further ado, modal:

I thought it would be nice to build logic circuits out of nand:

<> (nand #t #t) #f
<> (nand #t #f) #t
<> (nand #f #t) #t
<> (nand #f #f) #t

?(?-) (It seems we have to explicitly unpack if we want to build things with nand)
?(?-) (I suspect this is because I am inadvertantly matching non-boolean expressions)
?(?-) (more on this later?)

<> (nand (?x) (?y)) (nand ?x ?y)

?(?-) (The rest of the circuitry)
<> (not ?x) (nand ?x ?x)
<> (and ?x ?y) (not (nand ?x ?y))
<> (or ?x ?y) (nand (not ?x) (not ?y))
<> (xor ?x ?y) (and (or ?x ?y) (nand ?x ?y))

?(?-) (Now can we build up some kind of if-else expression?)
?(?-) (We will have to unpack here as well?)
<> (if #t ?x ?y) ?x
<> (if #f ?x ?y) ?y
<> (eq ?x ?x) #t
<> (eq ?x ?y) #f

?(?-) (Somehow our ternary operator does not behave as expected.)

?(?-) (Eval: `(if (#f) True! False!)`)
.. if (eq #t #f) True!  False!

?(?-) (Evaluates to `False!`, which is more like what we would expect)
.. if eq #t #f True!  False!

?(?-) (So, why is it that we seem to rewrite to a token sometimes and a one-element tuple other times?)

?(?-) (I decide to go and cover some basics)

?(?-) (A rule has the following syntax)
?(?-) (<> left right)
<> hello goodbye
.. hello          ?(?-) (evaluates to `goodbye`)
.. hellogoodbye   ?(?-) (no match; no rule is applied)

?(?-) (What if we want to evaluate to something a little bigger than a token?)
?(?-) (tuples are "unpacked", I think this is a vocabulary word I am possibly misusing.)
<> good (even better)
.. good bye       ?(?-) (evaluates to "even better bye")


?(?-) (Use registers)
<> (swap ?x ?y) (?y ?x)
<> (spin ?x ?y ?z) (?y ?z ?x)

.. swap it out            ?(?-) (evaluates to `out it`)
.. spin me right round    ?(?-) (evaluates to `right round me`)
.. spin swap a b c d e    ?(?-) (evaluates to `a b d c e`)
.. spin (swap a b) c d e  ?(?-) (evaluates to `c d (b a) e`)

?(?-) (I get as far as the I/O section before realizing that rule evaluation is tricky)

?(?-) (Consider I/O, maybe we want to check if a user enters the same thing twice?)
?(?-) (use the ?~ register to read input)
?(?-) (Oh, actually I don't know how to use stdin as an arg twice)
<> (read ?~) ?~
<> (eq ?x ?x) (these terms are equivalent)
<> (eq ?x ?y) (these terms are different)


?(?-) (Oops, we match the eq rule here, and always get the true result.)
eq (read stdin) (read stdin)


?(?-) (How would we achieve application of `eq` to the results of two sequential reads?)

<p>:: I decide to try zooming in on what was confusing me above ::</p>

<pre>

?(?-) (I will try to dig a little more into tuple/token rewriting now)


<> (does-this-wrap ?x) (?x)
.. does-this-wrap abc     ?(?-) (evaluates to `abc`)
.. does-this-wrap (abc)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `(abc)`)
.. (does-this-wrap abc)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `(abc)`)
.. (does-this-wrap (abc)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((abc))`)


<> (what-about-this ?x) ?x
.. what-about-this efg     ?(?-) (evaluates to `efg`)
.. what-about-this (efg)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `(efg)`)
.. (what-about-this efg)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `(efg)`)
.. (what-about-this (efg)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `((efg))`)


<> (and-this ?x) ((?x))
.. and-this hij     ?(?-) (evaluates to `(hij)`)
.. and-this (hij)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `((hij))`)
.. (and-this hij)   ?(?-) (evaluates to `((hij))`)
.. (and-this (hij)) ?(?-) (evaluates to `(((hij)))`)
