<h1>investing in loss</h1>
<p>my teacher taught me the phrase 'investing in loss'</p>
<p>if you practice to cultivate some active principle, then you should reject anything that runs counter to that principle</p>
<p>you have to know what you're trying to cultivate</p>
<p>you have to know what you can do to cultivate it</p>
<p>and you have to be willing to lose, again, and again, rather than accept the easier alternative which does not cultivate it</p>

<!-- <p>he taught me this in the context of martial art</p> -->
<!-- <p>I could learn the precise methodology of the elemental weapons of the Gesar Gar-Tak system</p> -->
<!-- <p>or I can learn the methodology of leverage and technique deployed in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</p> -->
<!-- <p>to be a good grappler is a wonderful thing</p> -->
<!-- <p>but I am training to cultivate the practice of Gar-tak</p> -->
