<h1>I have already tried</h1>
<p>I have already tried:</p>
<p>Dualistic Eternalism</p>
<p>Dualistic Nihilism</p>
<p>Eternalist Monism</p>
<p>Nihilistic Monism</p>
<p>and found each of them lacking</p>
<p>so if I ever appear to reject Buddhism, which rejects eternalism, nihilism, dualism, and monism -- then you can be sure I've gone and busted</p>
