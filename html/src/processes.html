<h2>3 Level Habits</h2>

<p>L3: the absolute best form, most ideal form, best application of the habit</p>
<blockquote><i>for example, a full 3-4 hour long production session</i></blockquote>

<p>L2: A lesser form, but still a commitment of some time and energy</p>
<blockquote><i>e.g. turning on your octatrack, and arranging some patterns, or recording something</i></blockquote>

<p>L1: The least form of the habit, something that you can <em>always</em> do</p>
<blockquote><i>e.g. turning on the octatrack and just playing a pattern, or putting a couple of trigs down, and just <em>noticing something</em></i></blockquote>

<p>This will keep your momentum going</p>

<h2>You Need To Do It And You Don't Want To</h2>

<p>- make one (1) cup of tea and then sit down and face whatever it is</p>

<p>- set yourself a 15 minute timer and spend that time doing it</p>
