  What is the danger or trouble from which we seek refuge in the context
  of our lives as Buddhists? Here we seek protection
  from our own conceptual minds ... In order to arrive at the point of
  realising that we need protection, however, we need to have reached some
  understanding that we create our own unhappiness or dissatisfaction with life.
