<h1>What makes something low level</h1>
<p>What makes something low-level?</p>
<p>This is a vague term, let's say it pertains to things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>C programming, or any kind of systems programming where you're pushing bits around</li>
  <li>Assembly programming</li>
  <li>Chip architecture</li>
  <li>Virtual Machine design</li>
  <li>Compiler and/or langauge design</li>
</ul>
<p>Something seems to be "low-level" when it's in closer contact with the "real world"</p>
<p>But an html login form is very much in contact with the real world,
and most wouldn't say that writing an HTML form is low-level.</p>
<p>So, I think low-level is probably talking about levels in terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">Open Systems Interconnections</a> model.</p>
<p>i.e. anything pertaining to layer 1 (physical), or maybe layers 1-4 (physical -&gt; data link -&gt; network -&gt; transport)</p>
