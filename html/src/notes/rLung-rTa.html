      rLung rTa—Wind Horse— is enjoyment. Enjoyment means to <i>occasion</i> or
      to <i>engender</i> joy. Joy is upliftedness— the natural response to
      phenomena, and to being alive.

      To raise rLung rTa is to rise above quotidian pedestrianism. Everyday
      walking can be elevated. It is certainly the equal of flying a jet just
      above the tree tops — one needs to be vitally present.

      rLung rTa is upliftedness — the spirit of enjoyment within everything
      within reality. rLung rTa contrasts with depression — the feeling of
      expectations not being met: the mistaken sense of
      <i>it being my right to be happy</i>. Whether I'm happy or not, is
      entirely dependent on 'me'.

      The upliftedness of rLung rTa is possible for anyone. It simply requires
      being alive to the sensations of being alive. It requires doing nothing
      half-heartedly. It requires washing in the morning and wearing clean
      clothes. At the very minimum one could tuck one's shirt into one's
      trousers. That chould be an important beginning.

      rLung rTa is connected with Drala — the living quality of phenomena. rLung
      rTa and Drala are closely related — because they both engender a sense of
      heightened appreciation of the sense fields and everything they contain.
      <em>This sense can be cultivated</em>. rLung rTa is a sense of
      deliberateness in terms of constantly reminding ourselves to appreciate.
      When walking through the woods, one can ask
      <i>"Am I actually hearing the birds?"</i> We can be actively involved in
      enjoyment— rather than being passive viewers of phenomena.

    <p>I once asked my teacher:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Are there any inherent problems with spending an afternoon playing video games?</p>
      <p>
      I've heard you say, in reference to practice, or training the mind, or
      watching film westerns, that "this isn't wasted time". It makes me wonder
      what is wasted time?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>She replied:</p>
    <blockquote>What is wasted is up to you.</blockquote>
