  <blockquote>
    "What is the imputed identity to which karma could adhere?

    What is this entity that has karma? 

    If there is insolubale karma there must be an insoluble entity to
    whom it belongs. 

    Buddha Shakyamuni explicitly stated that there was no basis for 
    such an entity.

    This is the meaning of the word <i title="bDag med / anatman">dag'm√®d</i>"

  <blockquote>
    "There is no solid, permanent, separate, continuous or defined aspect
    to beingness. There are only characteristics which are continually in flux.

    When imputed identity vanishes -- karma vanishes.

    Both are merely dualistic derangement."
