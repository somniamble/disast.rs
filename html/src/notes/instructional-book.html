<h1>How to read a book</h1>

<section>
  <p>Books are a sequential, linear arrangement of text and graphics. These are organized by <i>page</i>, which are
    sometimes further organized in terms of <i>chapters</i></p>

  <p>If you've gotten a book that's going to <i>Teach You How</i>, it's probably arranged such that the later pages
    require some <i>basic skill</i> introduced in the earlier chapters.</p>

  <p>I've had the most success with these starting at the beginning, and proceeding to the end.</p>
  <p>I prefer to go one page at a time, one section at a time, one chapter at a time.</p>
  <p>If there are exercises, I try to <i>actually do every single one.</i></p>
  <p>I try and read every word on page and do every exercise, even if I find myself a little bored</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h2>The juice is in the boredom.</h2>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h2>Repeat Yourself.</h2>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Maybe it's that easy?</p>

  <p class="sep">: : What if it's not? : :</p>
  <p>I hear you say: "Rosin, I have read books in this manner and it is too slow"</p>
  <p>Ok: Here is an auxiliary method I have tried:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read every word on every page of every chapter, one after another, as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li>Don't worry too much about retention at this point, but try to keep a basic idea of the plot</li>
    <li>Take note of any recurring themes</li>
    <li>Write down every vocabulary word as it comes up the first time per chapter. Review these after.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After you've completed this grueling process, then start the book over, and go through it as before.</p>
  <p>You have now provided your conceptual mind with empty labelled boxes for the concepts the book will teach you</p>
  <p>Now when you read, you will have a better notion of what to pay attention to, and how the whole thing is laid out.</p>
  <p>Good luck!</p>
