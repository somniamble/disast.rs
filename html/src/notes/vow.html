  <p>If you develop the habit of keeping promises, then there is less friction, because you do what you say you'll do.</p>
  <p>Willfully breaking promises undermines your ability to <em>keep</em> promises.</p>
  <p>This in turn undermines your ability to <a href="strategy.html">execute ideas</a>.</p>
  <p>In order to preserve your execution, you may develop conceptual elaborations (rationalization, justification).</p>
  <p>This is expensive -- it takes mental effort -- it's even in the word: e<em>labor</em>ation.</p>
  <p>You develop the habit of acting according to your private caveats &amp; justifications, rather than your word.</p>
  <p>: : : :</p>
  <p>That all might be ok if you're in the business of trying to find the <em>perfect reference point</em> by which to order your behavior</p>
  <p>It's rubbish if you're Buddhist, because there is <i><a href="anatman.html">no eternal, unchanging reference point.</a></i></p>
  <p>What this means is, hypocrisy is a losing game -- your self-justification will collapse under increasing complexity and you'll end up discarding it anyway.</p>
