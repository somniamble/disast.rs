<h1>.NET Memory Heap Dump</h1>

Maybe you also need to check if your pod is leaking memory --

Here's how I did this on a pod running alpine linux:

<pre>
  # Get a shell on the container
  kubectl exec -it -n [your namespace] [your pod name] -- ash

  # everything below is run ON the container
  apk update
  apk add dotnet6-sdk
  export PATH="$PATH:/root/.dotnet/tools"
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-dump

  # get your PID -- probably PID 1 since this is a container
  dotnet-dump ps

  # generate dump
  # Quite possibly you will OOMkill from trying to write Heap dump,
  #  even though it is techincally smaller
  # dotnet-dump collect -p 1 --type Heap -o coredump

  # Generate a Full dump, basically an image of the application memory
  dotnet-dump collect -p 1 --type Full -o coredump

  # analyze, you can pipe this to a file or whatever you want
  # Sorted smallest to largest by total object class size
  dotnet-dump analyze coredump -c 'dumpheap -stat' -c 'exit'
</pre>
