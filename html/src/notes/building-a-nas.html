  <h1>Building a Network-Attached Storage</h1>

  <p>December 2024, I decided I would finally build a NAS.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Disks</h2>
    <p>
      I had the good fortune to get a nice deal on some Seagate EXOS hard drives
      from serverpartdeals.com
    </p>
    <p>
      These are "manufacturer-recertified" HDDs, so they used to live in a
      datacenter somewhere.
    </p>
    <h3>SMART testing the disks</h3>
    <p>
      It stands for
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology"
        >Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology"</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a self-reporting diagnostic tool provided by a drive's firmware.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also try writing <code>0</code> to every single sector on the
      drive and see if any sectors are <em>not</em> all <code>0</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>
      I tried badblocks originally, but it can't handle a hard drive with more
      than 2<sup>32</sup> blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a pinch, Arch Wiki recommends
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Badblocks#Alternatives"
        >smartctl or <i>writing 0</i> to the device</a
      >. I decided on a long smart test.
    </p>
    <pre>
      # could also write 0s
      # cryptsetup open /dev/sda new_hard_drive_1 --type plain --cipher aes-xts-plain64
      # shred -v -n 0 -z /dev/mapper/new_hard_drive_1
      # cmp -b /dev/zero /dev/mapper/new_hard_drive_1

      man smartctl # is your friend
      # Decided to use smartmontools
      # Sketches me out that it was recognized at /dev/sda. Nevertheless.
      sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sda # starts long test, it says to wait 1742 minutes (~29 hours) to finish. I started
      about 2025-01-08 13:00.
      sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda # "Print a large amount of SMART information for drive /dev/sda"
    </pre>
    <h3>Power draw</h3>
    <p>
      HDDs draw both 5V and 12V power; spinning a platter 7200 times a minute is
      hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on
      <a href="/file/exos-x20-product-manual.pdf">the product manual</a> for my
      HDDs, that looks like:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Current</th>
        <th>Wattage</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Max 5V</td>
        <td>0.932</td>
        <td>4.66</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Max 12V</td>
        <td>2.197</td>
        <td>26.364</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Idle 5V</td>
        <td>0.298</td>
        <td>1.49</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Idle 12V</td>
        <td>0.340</td>
        <td>4.08</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

      Assuming I want to scale this out to 5 drives at some point, and erring on
      the side of caution:
    </p>
    <p>
      I would need <em>at least</em> <b>30 W of 5V</b>, and <b>150 of 12V</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with a couple of fans, 200W might be enough. that's a pretty small
      PSU.
    </p>

    <p>I decided to go with a Corsair CX-550</p>

    <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
    <p>I wasn't sure how to set my disks up -- I have two to spare for this (I'm using my 3rd in my desktop)</p>
    <p>However, I found a rather helpful reddit post:</p>
    <blockquote>I have a few Synology NASes here. With the last one, a RackStation 1619xs+, as an experiment, I started with two drives and expanded the array from RAID type to RAID type.

I started with a simple mirror, RAID 1. I added another drive and changed the RAID type to RAID 5. The machine rebuilt the array to incorporate the new drive. There was no data lost.

I then added additional drives until there were eight. After the array was rebuilt incorporating the new drives, I converted it to RAID 6, which required me to add a ninth drive.

The conversion of RAID 5 with eight drives to RAID 6 with nine drives took almost exactly three months. I did not use the NAS during that time, though I could have.

I all cases, I was able to expand the array and add drives as necessary or desired. There was never any data loss.
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, I'll start with RAID 1, which is simple mirroring.</p>
