<h1>Hash</h1>

<p>
  So much of our modern digital infrastructure is built off hash tables, it
  seems I should have an entry.

  <blockquote>You can think of a hash table as a dynamic array, 
              with a really strange policy for inserting items.

    <h3>Hash Functions</h3>
    <blockquote>Many hash functions follow the same pattern. You start with some
      initial hash value, usually a constant with certain carefully chosen
      mathematical properties. Then you walk the data to be hashed. For each
      byte, you mix the bits into the hash value somehow, and then scramble
      the resulting bits around some.

  <ul>
    <li><h4>Collision</h4>:
      <p>Occurs when the calculated index (i.e. <i>hash</i>) of two elements 
         in a hashtable are the same.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Load Factor</h4>:
      <p>The ratio between the size of a hash table, and the number of elements it contains</p></li>
    <li><h4>Separate Chaining</h4>:
      <p>A strategy for resolving collisions between elements wherein each <i>bucket</i>
      of a hash table points to a linked-list of elements, rather than a single position. </p>
      <p>It's simple to implement, but tends to be memory inefficient.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Open Addressing</h4>
      <p>Also known as "closed hashing"</p>
      <p>A hashing technique wherein each element is stored directly in the table</p>
      <p>Upon collision, the table <i>probes</i> for the next available bucket.</p>
      <p>The simplest form of probing is <i>linear probing</i>, in which the table
         walks its internal array looking for the first open bucket.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Clustering</h4>
      <p>The presence of multiple entries in one section of the table</p>
      <p>High degrees of clustering in a table suggest a different hashing
         algorithm or probing algorithm may be appropriate.</p>
