<h1>Reference and Referencelessness</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    Chogyam Trungpa describes the Setting-Sun mentality as one which believes
    completely in reference points
  </p>
  <p>
    One believes totally that: one can use reference points to define oneself
    and -- further -- maybe some configurations of reference points will be more
    durable, and better, than others
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, such a person is always trying to arrange for "better"
    reference points
  </p>
  <p>
    This is dangerous, because the single defining characteristic of reference
    points is that they are <i>temporary.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    The setting sun mentality is one which fears the basic ground of existence
    -- which is empty, beyond concept, beyond any sense of referentiality.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is nothing to manipulate as a reference point there -- so one responds
    to it by trying to fill it with <i>things</i>-- with varying degrees of
    success
  </p>

    The coward lives in constant terror of space ... The coward is afraid of
    darkness because he can't see anything. He is afraid of silence because he
    can't hear anything. Cowardice is turning the unconditional into a situation
    of fear by inventing reference points, or conditions, of all kinds.

  <h2>Moral Relativity</h2>
  <p>
    In light of the transience of reference points, or that the only durable
    truth is transience of relative truth, it seems worth asking about morality.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I identify as a Mormon, it would be moral for me to abstain from coffee
    and alcohol, abstain from food on the first sunday of the month, attain a
    marriage in the temple, and generally try to bring others into the faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    That would be moral, in reference to the ethics laid out by the LDS Church
  </p>
  <p>
    If I identify as secular Ex-Mormon, it would be moral for me to have coffee
    and alcohol as often as I pleased, to fast only for the health benefits, to
    experiment with hallucinogens and "alternative" spiritualities, and to
    generally try to bring those that are still Mormon <i>out</i> of their
    faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    That would be moral, in (rebellious) reference to the ethics laid out by the
    LDS Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    It could be moral to pull the lever in the gas chamber, in reference to the
    ethics of Germany's Third Reich.
  </p>
  <p>
    It could be moral to machine-gun women and children from a helicopter, in
    reference to the ethics of the Vietnam war.
  </p>
  <p>
    It could be moral say "please" and "thank you" and "you're welcome" and to
    keep one's elbows off the table, in reference to the ethics of polite
    society.
  </p>
  <p>
    It could be easy to come to the conclusion that -- moral relativism
    prevails, and one can behave however one would like, in reference to the
    ethics of nihilism.
  </p>
  <p>
    In all such cases, it seems like that <i>could</i> miss the point, because
    one is acting according to temporary reference points -- because one
    fundamentally believes that the reference points they use to establish their
    identity as a Mormon, Ex-Mormon, German citizen, American soldier, Polite
    Person, are all that separate them from oblivion.
  </p>
  <p>Nihilism is another reference point, another strategy.</p>
