<h1>DIY :: Refinement</h1>

    <p>An observation:</p>
    <p>On-demand text search (think Google) makes you reliant to on-demand text search.</p>
    <p>You don't remember the specific piece of information you're looking 
       for any more --

       rather, you've offloaded the particulars and now you remember how to 
       work the interface to access it, plus the minimum amount of information
       required to feed the interface.</p>

    <p>When was the last time you drove somewhere for the first time without
       navigation software?</p>
    <p>Regularly using a tool makes you reliant on that tool.</p>

    <p>That could be ok -- we use tools to accomplish more than our human
       bodies can accomplish on their own. That is part of why we are able
       to thrive -- it's natural for humans to do.</p>

    <p>It does seem worth asking if you're well-served when you're using a
       tool to accomplish a task <i>you could do by hand</i>.</p>

    <p>Until you've tried and failed, you might not know where the real limit 
       to your ability is. If you bail out and use a tool <em>before</em> then,
       you'll <em>never</em> find out.</p>

    <p>If you don't understand how a tool works -- if you can't replicate its
       behavior -- then are you well-served by relying on it?</p>

    <p>The answer to these questions isn't always "no". There's <em>always</em> 
       more to life than a single person can accomplish.</p>

    <p>but I think you have
       to ask yourself these things. I think it's important.</p>

<p>Here is a repeatable procedure:</p>
<p>Do it all by hand first</p>
<p>Note where the <a href="friction.html">friction</a> is.</p>
<p>Eventually, factor out some of that friction with an automated process</p>
<p>(Examples?)</p>
