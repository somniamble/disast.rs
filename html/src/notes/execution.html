  <p>I was thinking that my process is pointing me towards making as much of what
  I do into a series of composable <a href="/file/andy-matuschak-executable-strategy-2025-04-16.html">executable strategies</a> 
  as possible.</p>
  <h4>Here's the thought process:</h4>
  <p>I can make a limited number of decisions per day</p>
  <p>For each decision, I can only tolerate a limited number of options until I get "overloaded"</p>
  <p>So, any time a decision comes up, I should try and constrain my options.</p>
  <p>I should also try and limit the amount of times I need to make a decision.</p>
  <h4>Some observations:</h4>
  <p>I often have to make the same decision repeatedly</p>
  <p>More decisions in a process leads is perceived as friction</p>
  <p>I can let <em>my past self</em> make decisions for me. I do this by letting my past self dictate my current self's constraints.</p>
  <p>In other words, I <a href="vow.html">make a promise</a>.</p>
