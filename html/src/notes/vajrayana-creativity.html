<p><h1>Vajrayana is dead sexy</h1></p>
<h2>Vajrayana <i>is</i> the creative process</h2>
<p>the 'real magic' of Vajrayana seems to be the way it conjures with personal possibility</p>
<p>early on in my apprenticeship with the Aro lineage, a friend of mine asked 'Do you want to become a mahasiddha and fly around and stuff'</p>
<p>I thought, "who wouldn't?", but also wondered if this was missing the point</p>
<p>Vajrayana seems to offer something which is <i>beyond:</i></p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>hope and fear</li>
  <li>praise and blame</li>
  <li>gain and loss</li>
  <li>meeting and parting</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><blockquote>
  "Vajrayana does not concern itself with salvation and damnation as polarized possibilities -- or with heaven and hell as polarised locations.
  Rather, Vajrayana engages with <i>neurotic energy as the fundamental creative malleability</i> of the situation in which human strength and weakness
  -- openness and constriction -- become inextricably woven as the energetic context of liberation"

<p>I guess this statement could seem abstract if you aren't already a vajrayana practitioner -- but to me it suggests something about feasting on the apparent paradoxes of life, the pain and pleasure inherent in every situation -- something totally unconcerned with conventional viewpoints or rules about 'how to be & what it is & why'</p>
<p><h2>precision and passion</h2></p>
<p>to me, Vajrayana seems to be the recognition that <i>reality itself</i> is this continual series of creative opportunities.</p>
<p>There isn't any sort of persistent personage or enduring identity, you keep changing, your environment keeps changing, no single <i>thing</i> endures -- but the play of <i>form</i> dissolving into <i>emptiness</i> and <i>emptiness</i> producing <i>form</i> is endless -- <i>nothing</i> endures. <i>no thing</i> endures.</p>
<p>that could be terrifying, that could be ecstatic, that could be utterly beyond description</p>
<p><h2>buddhism</h2></p>
<p>buddhism as a term doesn't point to a single, unitary religion <i>as such</i></p>
<p>you could say that we use the term 'buddhism' because 'totally clear, awake awareness-ism' doesn't roll off the tongue so nice</p>
<p>because <i>form</i> is limitless in it's arising (things are always changing, never the same), there are all sorts of methods for realizing that form and emptiness are inseparable</p>
<p>the methods all fall under the general cultural umbrella term of 'Buddhism', but it seems important to say there's no belief there in the one-true-way</p>
<p>dharma means "as it is". The teachings point to reality "as it is", and the practices help one see reality "as it is", and that's <i>all</i> there is to it</p>
<p>that <i>could be</i> disappointing, because it dispenses with any illusions & delusions about what reality is</p>
<p>that <i>could be</i> quite freeing, because there is no energy spent contriving or coercing reality into something other than what it already is</p>
<!-- <p>(I say <i>could be</i> because presently I am <i>finding out</i>) -->
