<h1>REMINDERS</h1>

<p>or "things i have to remind myself of"</p>

<h2>Make Fewer Decisions</h2>

<p>You get to make a finite amount of decisions in the day, that's how you get to actually <i>express</i> the juice.</p>

<p>This is <i>maybe</i> why limitations are so useful -- they remove your options, so you have less decisions to make.</p>

<p>You have less decisions to make, so the ones you <i>do</i> choose stand out.</p>

<p>There's less room to hide. That's nice.</p>

<h2>(When In Doubt,) Do Less</h2>

<h2>Do It By Hand First</h2>

<p>Off-the-shelf solutions, quick fixes, convenience functions, tools, etc, are <i>not</i> going to make sense until you've gone and done the tedious/difficult/scary thing yourself</p>

<p>You can really be as granular as you'd like about this.</p>

<p>Suck it and see, basically</p>
