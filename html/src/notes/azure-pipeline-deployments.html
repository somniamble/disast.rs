<h1>Azure Pipeline Deployments</h1>

<p>Consider, in the abstract, you need to deploy some resource into some environment.</p>

<p>This resource is an artifact of some kind, generated by another azure pipeline.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a <code>production</code> environment, and you'd only like to deploy if this artifact was generated from a build pipeline running against the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a <code>development</code> environment, and you don't mind deploying any old thing against it.</p>
