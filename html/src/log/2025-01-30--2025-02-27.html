    <h2>February 2nd, 2025</h2>
    <p>My life is proceeding at the pace of evaporating solvents</p>
    <!-- <p>Chris Hauder says that "Environment is stronger than will" -- which is to say that</p> -->
    <!-- <p>The shape of the container dictates the contents, more than we would think</p> -->
    <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
    <p>When I picked up the guitar, I had the idea of learning to play it.</p>
    <p>I also had the idea of using it to learn music theory.</p>
    <p>Seeing as a music-theory-oriented guitar practice hasn't manifested on its own, I might need to find or come up
      with a curriculum.</p>

    <h2>February 6th, 2025</h2>
    <p>I factory reset all my gear today</p>
    <p>I don't need all of that stuff that I accumulated</p>
    <p>It feels nice -- and light</p>
    <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
    <p>One of my training partners said today --</p>
    <blockquote>"Why are you so down on yourself?"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"You want to be so good at this."</blockquote>
    <p>He's not entirely wrong-- and maybe I could lighten up on the mats too.</p>
    <p>My teacher suggested that I could let every music-making session be totally fresh.</p>
    <p>He has also suggested that I don't have to make everything -- good</p>
    <p>I probably won't come back to read these log entries forever -- maybe not ever again, once the month is up</p>
    <p>So I also probably don't need to fret endlessly about them being good</p>
    <p class="sep">: : even so : :</p>
    <p>I want to approach things in a disciplined way -- what's up with that?</p>
    <p>Maybe there is some energy involved in discipline, and maybe that's interesting to me.</p>

    <h2>February 7th, 2025</h2>
    <p>I still have a great deal of exported recordings from 2024, even if I lack the raw recordings and project files</p>
    <p>Listening to some in the car today, I thought, "Well, what if I make The Blob 2?"</p>

    <h2>February 11th, 2025</h2>
    <p>My weekends go by in a blur of intensive training</p>
    <p>It seems I sprained my knee during a spar</p>
    <p>These competition-style rolls are dangerous.</p>
    <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
    <p>I was thinking, "I don't really have time for music any more, do I?"</p>
    <p>"I can't do this, AND the martial arts, AND the day job"</p>
    <p>I decided I couldn't say that until I was <i>truly</i> making the effort to get up early.</p>
    <p>I mean 4:30 AM early.</p>
    <p>I mean 6 hours before work starts early.</p>
    <p class="sep">: : so it seems : :</p>
    <p>here's one advantage to exploring your limits</p>
    <p>When you encounter a hard limit, the decisions are easy.</p>
    <p>The decisions are easy, because you know what works, and what doesn't.</p>
    <p>You know what <i>doesn't</i> work, because you tried and failed, maybe <i>a lot.</i></p>
    <p>You probably need to try, and fail, <i>a <b>lot.</b></i>

      <p>I stopped writing here, because life started moving pretty fast</p>
      <p>SO, I lost the plot a bit.</p> <!-- Ok. Here I am again. -->
      <p>Maintaining a habit is: feeling inclined to do something, doing it, and feeling good about doing it.</p>
      <p>If you want to break a habit, best to not feel good about engaging in it.</p>
      <p class="sep">: : so? : :</p>
      <p>My knee feels better, but I'm taking it easier at training.</p>
      <p>I'm probably in for a thrashing at competition, next weekend, since I've had so little time on the mat this month</p>
      <p class="sep">: : and? : :</p>
      <p>Q: How do you pay attention?</p>
      <p>A: A sense of danger helps.</p>
      <p>Q: How do you wake up?</p>
      <p>A: A threat on your life helps.</p>
      <p class="sep">: : interesting, go on : :</p>
      <p>Don't fool yourself.</p>
