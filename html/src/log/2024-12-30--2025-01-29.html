    <h2>January 11th - January 13th, 2025</h2>
    <p>Spent much of the weekend in the woodshop</p>
    <p>I've been engaged in an ongoing improvement of my office</p>
    <p>
      Last summer I repainted it the colors of the sky -- but I never got the
      baseboards in
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a rather strangely shaped room, as it's on the outer edge of an
      octagonal geodesic dome
    </p>
    <p>
      The baseboards have joints at angles I found difficult, and I put them
      off.
    </p>
    <p>On the 10th, I measured the room and cut them all, then painted them.</p>
    <p>
      Then, on the 11th, I nailed them into the walls. To my horror and dismay
      (/s) I discovered the walls are somewhat crooked. Some of my baseboards,
      particularly on the outer wall, refuse to lay flat.
    </p>
    <p>One can of foam-fill later, the outer-wall baseboards are laid flat.</p>
    <p>I will admit that I became sloppy in my approach with the caulk. . .</p>

    <p>So many things to do.</p>
    <p class="sep">: : : :</p>
    <p>
      As I go about my day, I will have an idea like "oh, I should make a mix of
      a bunch of songs I like."
    </p>
    <p>Oh, I should make a song that sounds like this:</p>
    <p>Oh, I should draw little comics for these posts</p>
    <p>
      Oh, I should write about ideas that I have, so that I can remember them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I should get a matcha cup and brush, so that I can make "traditional"
      matcha
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I should have a website that other people can read, and so that when I
      need to reference something I can go look at it.
    </p>
    <p>There's a constellation here:</p>
    <p>"Do things, to be in the habit of doing things"</p>
    <p>"Limit the things you do, to make it easier to do those things."</p>
    <p>
      Like water eroding a channel, the more focus/activity/attention/awareness
      in a direction blows shit <i>out of the way</i>
    </p>
    <p>More awareness is always good.</p>
    <p>
      I used to obsess about "authenticity", about going and living the
      "authentic" life
    </p>
    <p>
      But I second-guessed a lot and thought that I couldn't decide on the
      "authentic" life. Is it studying hard and getting my degree, then going
      for graduate studies, then working in a lab to cure cancer and solve the
      problem of human mortality? Is it hitch-hiking across the country? Is it
      taking estrogen and going to parties and having a lot of unprotected sex?
      Is it shaving my hair and becoming a nun? Is it moving to the woods?
      Living off the land? Living off a sailboat? Getting married and having a
      family? A career? A million dollars?
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't ever decide, see, they all sound good, but they're
      <i>over there</i> and I seem to be <i>right here</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See, if I could dream of anything, and do that, maybe I'd dream of what
      and where I am right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      so maybe the authentic life is whatever I can do, right here, with
      complete presence, avoiding nothing, needing nothing in particular other
      than what there is
    </p>
    <p>It's a working hypothesis.</p>
    <p>
      To get back to my original thought: I was thinking of doing something. If
      I do it, I'll post it [here].

      Last year I decided to start tracking my live-rolling time down to the
      minute. I had a hypothesis that at <i>about</i> 30 hours of live matches I
      would have a blue belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was given my blue belt in December after 29 hours -- and I immediately
      set out to add more time
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped keeping track after 30 hours. I would guess that now I'm at a
      little more than 35 hours now based on how much I tend to get in during a
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road from blue to purple takes at least two years, per IBJJF belting
      rules. However it seems reasonable to say I'll be
      <i>well on the way</i> at about 100 hours.

      I've reached the point learning my

    </p>
    <p>
      I've been following along with a book <i>Guitar From Scratch</i>. I'm
      taking the approach I normally do with such books -- go one page at a
      time, and attempt every exercise at least once.

    <p>The month has come and gone.</p>

    <p>It occured to me today that really, this month has been about finishing what I've already started -- no new projects.</p>
    <p>I've come down with a cold, so I called out sick.</p>
    <p>I meant to rest, instead I stripped and stained cabinets.</p>
    <p>I could make some kind of observation like "I'm learning this new skill, staining and finishing wood, isn't that marvelous, I could become a woodworker —"</p>
    <p>It's not about that, though; this excursion in home improvement isn't a way to "upskill" into a career in house flipping.</p>
    <p>It also occurred to me it could be some way of "learning to communicate effectively with my environment" <!-- (yuck) -->, but it really seems false (and simpleminded) to say that's why I'm doing it.</p> 
    <p>It occurred to me that it would look nice if I painted the trim for my room and installed it properly, without gaps — so I set out to do that and then I kept at it until it was finished.</p>
    <p>Then it occurred to me that it would look nice if the heavily-water-damaged kitchen cabinets had a fresh coat of stain and sealer — so I set out to do that and am now keeping at it until it is finished.</p>

    <p>It also piles up.</p>

    <p>It is wonderful to start a new project.</p>

    <p>That is one function of a "project" — a container for expression.</p>
    <p>It has a beginning, middle, and end.</p>
    <p>You might have something when you finish.</p>
    <p>You might not.</p>
    <p>You could engage in an infinite, linear series of projects <!-- until you die -->, but that's not the art. Those aren't where the art "lives".</p>

    <p>If there's no end-state, it seems risky to embark on a project.</p>
