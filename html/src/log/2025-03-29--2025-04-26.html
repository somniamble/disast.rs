<h1>Snake month, Female Wood Snake Year (Year 2152)</h1>
<article>
  <p>
    This month is the first I formally reckon according to the <a href="/notes/aro-calendar.html">Tibetan lunar
      calendar</a>.
  </p>
  <p>It's an experiment in <a href="https://aroterlineage.org/en/teachings/living-the-view/">living</a> the <a

  <p>It seems helpful, at the outset of some period, to state your orientation -- bearing -- attitude -- intention</p>

    I suckered myself into reading some essays about AI yesterday,
    in roughly this order:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/04/02/ai-ambivalence/">AI Ambivalence</a>
      <p>"Here’s the main problem I’ve found with generative AI, and with 'vibe coding'
        in general: it completely sucks out the joy of software development for me."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer">The death of the junior developer</a>
      <p>This one got me because it was referenced as "CHOP" in the "Revenge of the junior developer"</p>
      <p>The author predicts that AI will totally obliterate junior engineers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer">Revenge of the junior developer</a>
      <p>The same author as "The death of the junior developer"</p>
      <p>"Switch to chat. Ditch completions. Stop writing code by hand.
        Learn how validation and verification work in the new world.
        Familiarize yourself with the space, and follow the state of the art.
        Stop whinging and turn this into an engineering exercise.
        Stay on top of it. You can do it."</p>
      <p>(This author makes a living selling genAI.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://shadowfacts.net/2025/ai/">On AI</a>
      <p>An essay about not ceding ground</p>
      <p>"I guess I'm with the Luddites now."</p>
      <p>(I agree)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/is-it-okay/">Is it okay?</a>
      <p>An essay about Everything the sum total of human creative output in the commons.</p>
      <p>"You gotta take care of your own soul, and I’m writing this because I want to clarify mine."</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sep">. . .</p>
  <p>How exhausting.</p>
  <p>I cannot imagine anything I would want to do personally that I would also be willing to hand off to an AI agent.
  </p>
  <p>Maybe that's a personal problem.</p>

    <p>Let myself get nerd-sniped, <em>hard</em>, by implementing nested string interpolation for clox.</p>

    <p>I followed a thread on "evergreen note-taking" and ended up producing a pile of connected notes:</p>
    <p>I think I'm starting to circle around a sweet-spot intersection of music &amp; math -- engineering, research, art</p>
    <p>I'm still writing this site basically by hand (except for the phraxOS script). I don't want to try and scale it out too far, and I think this is important to get right.</p>

I really like doing stuff in these &lt;pre&gt; blocks, reminds me
of the good-old-days of writing everything in plain text source files.

This is a test <a href="/">internal link</a>

This is an <h2>h2</h2>
This is an <h3>h3</h3>
This is an <h4>h4</h4>
This is an <h5>h5</h5>

  <h2>April 19th, 2025</h2>
  <p>I've been thinking about how to break <a href="/notes">what I do</a> up into
     <a href="/notes/execution.html">executable strategies</a>, or "procedures"; 
     basically discrete, focused chunks of activity. It's important that they're
     focused, or tightly contained in some way, because this makes it very easy
     to pour energy and attention into.</p>
  <p>One idea: take 30 minutes with a blank octatrack project and do whatever
     I can with it. Or, take 30 minutes with on OT project that has some stuff
     loaded, go to a new bank, and do whatever I can in 30 minutes.</p>
  <p>The point is <em>not</em> to make something finished, per se, or to make
     something slapdash, it's to do what<em>ever</em>. It's to practice being
     creatively and emotionally unblocked.</p>
  <p>Let's try it!</p>
  <p>: : : :</p>
  <p>That, was a fantastic idea.</p>
  <p>Next time I'll try to remember to record it all into reaper.</p>

    <p>The thing is, I want my plaintext notes to look like an alien markdown
       language that nobody has ever seen before</p>
    <p>Consider an adaptation of the para (?) method?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0yAy2j-9V0">No Boilerplate</a> has a useful video on the good parts of obsidian.</p>
    <p>I agree with him on some aspects of it.</p>
    <p>particularly:
    <ul>
      <li>don't use or rely on directory structures</li>
      <li>do use tags</li>
      <li>do use links</li>
      <li>make links easier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>my gripe is that obsidian is too much like plain oatmeal.</p>
    <p>I could start by making links a little easier</p>
