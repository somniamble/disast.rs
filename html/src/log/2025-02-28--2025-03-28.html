    <p>I have read that "writing is a muscle"</p>
    <!-- <p>"The only reason to do it is to do it."</p> -->
    <!-- <p>: : : :</p> -->
    <!-- <p>I'm sorry to say I let myself get out of the habit of writing here.</p> -->
    <p>Perhaps my writing-muscle is extraordinarily weak</p>
    <p>I do think that I prefer to keep my journaling off-line</p>
    <p>however, it was the intention and purpose of this site to put all of my journaling on-line, public and generally available.</p>
    <p>So, perhaps I will actually have to move out of my comfort zone.</p>

    <p>Learning that "Redial" is written in C is the final proof I need -- to know that I needn't ever over-complicate my music ever again.</p>
    <p>: : Ideas : :</p>
    <p>I would like for the current phase of the moon (relative to the post date) to show next to my posts</p>
    <p>I would also like to stop checking social media all the time, I can't believe I'm 30 and this is still a problem</p>
    <p>Maybe if I'm going to look at it I should only use the <a href="/notes/why-cli.html">cli</a> for it.</p>
    <p>I would like to stop using so many google searches</p>

    <h2>March 17th, 2025</h2>
    <p>I came here wanting to write something, but without anything to say</p>
    <p>This morning I was talking with my dad about, how hilariously poor my willpower and self-control is</p>
    <p>Basically if I want to do / not do something I have to sculpt my entire environment to make it easy / make it hard</p>
    <p>If there's no way to do that then I just have to put the rest of my life on hold to form / break the habit</p>
    <p>daylight-savings time change is miserable :: I had just gotten in the habit of going to bed early again</p>
    <p>"That must be why you leave your phone all over in odd places, at odd times"</p>
