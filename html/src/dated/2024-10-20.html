<p>hostile user interfaces</p>
<p>endlessly scrolling feeds are a hostile user interface</p>
<p>hostile because they aggress upon one's time and focus</p>
<p>: : : :</p>
<p><h2>choosing death</h2></p>
<p>i sometimes think -- "This thing that I'm thinking of writing about is too personal/too miniscule/too unimportant/too --" and so decide not to write it down, not commit it publicly</p>
<p>committing something publicly is <i>hot</i>, in the sense that it's enticing/scary</p>
<p><h2>disasters</h2></p>
<p>it might be obvious but the purpose of site was always to do something that might fail totally</p>
<p>it is rather against the spirit of the site to shy away from committing something because it's too --</p>
<p><h2>against too --</h2></p>
<p>too -- for what? I think that is an interesting question. when it feels too -- for me it indicates some internal friction.</p>
<p><h2>friction is interesting</h2></p>
<p>what could possibly be rubbing against what?</p>
<p>friction produces heat</p>
<p>machined parts often require continuous cooling due to the heat produced by a high-speed tool working their surface</p>
<p>maybe this site acts as a kind of high-speed rotary tool that machines the surface of my thoughts</p>
<p>just a thought</p>
