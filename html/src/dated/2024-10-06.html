<p>for me it has to start with doing</p>
<p>I was thinking this morning about the importance of boxes for creativity</p>
<p>how can you 'think outside the box' when there's <i>no box</i></p>
<p>thinking outside the box is communication with circumstances</p>
<p>thinking outside the box is creative communication with circumstances</p>
<p>thinking outside the box is creativity</p>
<p>we're all constrained by boxes we take for granted, or boxes of varying degrees of tangibility</p>
<p>the boxes are moving targets - i have a working set of 10 fingers and 10 toes today - it is not likely to be true for the entire duration of my life</p>
<h2>where was I?</h2>
<p>when I use a tool, it has to do something from the start</p>
<p>what's that 'do something'?</p>
<p>i get bored easily. i don't have much time. i get frustrated easily. i hate ricing. i have so many hours a day and so many days a week and I don't want to spend sunday morning re-writing my neovim config</p>
<p>there's no joy in that for me (I almost did that today)</p>
<p>but there's joy in using tools</p>
<p>there's joy in thinking outside the box</p>
<h2>now really, where was I?</h2>

<p>I'm procrastinating. see you later.</p>
<!-- <p>now, where was I?</p> -->
<!-- <p>the world is the pure land. it is already complete. it is self-perfected.</p> -->
<!-- <p>that's a matter of view</p> -->
<!-- <p>the world is my lover. he is reflected to me in every nuance of form and emptiness. he is dynamically connected to every circumstance. in some sense, there is no difference in the way I write these words and the way I caress his skin.</p> -->
<!-- <p>that's the practice</p> -->
<h2>we're gonna need a better box</h2>
<p>what if you made a box</p>
<p>then you thought outside the box</p>
<p>then your thinking outside the box became a dynamic property of a slightly different, slightly more interesting box?</p>
<p>then your next solution to 'thinking outside the box'</p>
<p>what would happen then?</p>
