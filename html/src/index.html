<h1>awake</h1>

<p>
This site is just me playing in the space, having fun, seeing what sticks.
Not take it too seriously, and something interesting may occur here.
That is my goal.
</p>

Presently I would like to use DISASTRS as a:
<ul>
  <li>personal writing space (a blog?)</li>
  <li>personal wiki, so that my notes can be <i>everybody's notes</i></li>
  <li>personal sandbox for making art over the internet</li>
</ul>

<p class="space">: : : :</p>

<p><b>Could always be bolder</b></p>

<p class="space">: : : :</p>

<p>
My site is becoming big enough that if I want to maintain it efficiently,
I will need to start generating HTML from markdown somehow. <i>nice</i>.
