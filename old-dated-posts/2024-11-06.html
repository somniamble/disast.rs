<!-- <p>I practice something called <i>Thug-je Reg-ja</i> which is a Tibetan term that can translate to "tactile -->
<!--   responsiveness"</p> -->
<!---->

<!-- <p>This practice of <i>Tactile Responsiveness</i> originates from the <i>Thang-tong Thug Thig</i>, which is a <i>gTerma</i> originating from the tibetan mahasiddha Thang-tong Gyalpo, revealed in the mind-stream of a 20th century gTerton named Rangrig Togden</p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>This particular gTerma, the <i>Thang-tong Thug Thig</i> (pronounced "tang-tong tug tik") consists almost entirely of <i>Dzogchen Long-de</i> practices</p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p><i>Long-de</i> could be translated as "Series of Vast Space" or "Series of Vast Expanse"</p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>It is one of the three series of Dzogchen, and it relates to practices of <i>non-dual sensation</i></p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>These practices relate to something called the <i>Pervasive Tsa-rLung</i> system.</p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>The rTsa-rLung system is the network of subtle nerves (rTsa) and subtle winds (rLung) -->

<!-- <p>I practice a psychophysical buddhist practice called "Thug-je Regja" or "Tactile Responsiveness"</p> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>One of the ways to access this practice is through martial arts. <i>Thug-je Regja</i> expressed through the martial -->
<!--   arts is connected to <i>Gar-tak Dradul Nenkyong</i>, which translates roughly to <i>Dancing Tiger Subdues Foes To -->
<!--     Protect Friends and Family</i></p> -->
