<h1>hemmed in</h1>
<p>recently I've had a very difficult time making music</p>
<p>e.g. i find myself starting a project, then getting totally 'lost in the sauce' as it were -- loading too many samples, trying too many things, getting my tracks on the octatrack mixed up -- generally losing focus and finding songs falling apart under their own weight</p>
<h2>the doppeltrack</h2>
<p>here are the specifications for my hypothetical octatrack:</p>
<p>room for 8 flex samples per project</p>
<p>2 tracks, each with an EQ, filter, delay, and one other effect</p>
<p>ability to resample, and fine-grained control of sample playback</p>
<p>up to 128 bars in an arrangement</p>
<p>only two patterns per arrangement</p>
<p>ability to crossfade between up to 4 different scenes</p>
<h2>rosin, why?<h2>
<p>i wanted to take as many options away from myself as possible and see what happened</p>
<p>I should say that in present tense, because it's ongoing</p>
<p>I want to take away as many options as possible with this piece of gear (the Elektron Octatrack) because presently I'm getting totally bewildered by options in music</p>
<p>and then I want to make some songs (2 of which are currently 'done')</p>
<p>and the songs don't have to do much, they could even be a single loop for 16 bars. I would accept that as a minimally complete song</p>
<p>then i'll make an EP</p>
<h2>friction</h2>
<p>sometimes life rubs me a little raw</p>
<p>sometimes a simple thing is all that's needed</p>
<p>sometimes it's done with very little effort</p>
<h2>limitations</h2>
<p>maybe the dumb, unclever way is better</p>
<p>maybe the dumb, unclever way is the only way it'll get done</p>
<p>maybe it's not dumb or unclever to be simple, it's merely simple</p>
<h2>friction</h2>
<p>when you're doing something unusual you're going to stick out</p>
<p>it's not that i feel the need to go looking for that,</p>
<p>but that feeling is how i know that at least im being honest</p>
<p>: : : :</p>
<p>you get to be really really good at one thing in life</p>
<p>i decided i wanted that thing to thread through everything else, so that i could always do it</p>
