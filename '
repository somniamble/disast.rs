<p><h1>Vajrayana is dead sexy</h1></p>
<p>the 'real magic' of Vajrayana seems to be the way it conjures with personal possibility</p>
<p>early on in my apprenticeship with the Aro lineage, a friend of mine asked 'Do you want to become a mahasiddha and fly around and stuff'</p>
<p>I thought, "who wouldn't?", but also wondered if this was missing the point</p>
<p>Vajrayana seems to offer something which is <i>beyond:</i></p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>hope and fear</li>
  <li>praise and blame</li>
  <li>gain and loss</li>
  <li>meeting and parting</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><blockquote>
  "Vajrayana does not concern itself with salvation and damnation as polarized possibilities -- or with heaven and hell as polarised locations.
  Rather, Vajrayana engages with <i>neurotic energy as the fundamental creative malleability</i> of the situation in which human strength and weakness
  -- openness and constriction -- become inextricably woven as the energetic context of liberation"
