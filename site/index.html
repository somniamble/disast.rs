    Hello!

    Today's date is <a href="/dates/2024/06/2024-06-08.html">2024-06-08</a>.

    This site is just me playing in the space, having fun, seeing what sticks.
    Something more interesting may occur here, that is my goal.

    Presently I would like to use DISASTRS as a:
    - personal writing platform (a blog?)
    - sandbox for making art over the internet

    I like the domain because:
    - I find the idea of evil omens & ill portents (bad stars) oddly moving
    - <a href="http://music.disasterpeace.com/">this artist</a>, whose music changed me
