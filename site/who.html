    Hi, call me cha'med - or somni - or rosin - or ros -

    basically I am not anybody, <i>however</i>

    My personal creative-ethic is to <i>never try to be good</i> -- or
    to do what's honest instead of what's good. I'm writing that here because,
    like any aspiration, it's an aspiration, and I often fall short of it.
    But if it's all public like this then maybe I'll forget a little less.

    :::: <!-- I like the idea of rolling a few random items here --> <!-- - <i>a  </i>: College Dropout -->

    I am
    - <i>an </i>: <a href="/gay.html">[ambiguity]</a>
    - <i>a  </i>: Software Engineer (by trade)
    - <i>a  </i>: Common Lisp Enjoyer
    - <i>a  </i>: Computer Musician
    - <i>a  </i>: Jiu Jitsu Fighter
    - <i>an </i>: Artist / Buddhist
    - <i>a  </i>: Buddhist / Artist
    <!--: I should probably break this out into a new page: -->
    The last two items are interesting me, because I realized that I could
    spend my life becoming extremely good at one thing, and one thing only.
    As the one thing that interests me most is raw creativity <i>itself</i>,
    I do everything from that ghestalt. <a class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

    Maybe artistic practice and Buddhist practice are <i>essentially</i> the same.
    Maybe form and emptiness are <i>not</i> separate.
    <i>Maybe</i>. I am finding out.

    That's an aspiration, and like any aspiration I often fall short of it.
    But if it's public then maybe I'll forget it a little less.
