    Hi, call me cha'med - or somni - or rosin - or cha -
    basically I am not anybody, <i>however</i>

    My personal creative-ethic is to <i>never try to be good</i> -- or
    to do what's honest instead of what's good. I'm writing that here because,
    like any aspiration, it's an aspiration, and I often fall short of it.
    But if it's all public like this then maybe I'll forget a little less.

    I <i>am</i> a:
    - Software engineer (by trade)
    - Common lisp enjoyer
    - Computer musician
    - Jiu Jitsu fighter
    - Artist / Buddhist
    - Buddhist / Artist
    <!-- I should probably break this out into a new page: -->
    The last two items are interesting me, because I realized that I could
    spend my life becoming extremely good at one thing, and one thing only.
    As the one thing that interests me most is raw creativity <i>itself</i>,
    I do everything from that ghestalt. 

    Maybe artistic practice and Buddhist
    practice are <i>essentially</i> the same.
    Maybe form and emptiness are <i>not</i> separate.
    <i>Maybe</i>. I am finding out.

    That's an aspiration, and like any aspiration I often fall short of it.
    But if it's public then maybe I'll forget it a little less.
    <!-- The one thing that interests me most is raw creativity <i>itself</i>. --> <!-- We could call it the nonduality of form and emptiness, --> <!-- kindness and awareness, --> <!-- Vajrayana, the path of empty form, <i>is</i> the creative process. -->
